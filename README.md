# Election Results Challenge

## Overview of Project
We were able to assist a Colorado Board of Elections employee in an electional audit. 
We were able to use the data given to us by Tom and return to him the total votes cast, 
the votes for each candidate and the percetage of votes for each candidate, and of course, 
the winner of the election. We used Python to complete this assignment. 
 
## Analysis and Challenges
We first created a code to determine the number of votes and the percentage for each candidate as well as the winner, Diana DeGette.  
We printed this code to the terminal but also learned how to execute it as a text file.  Differentiating the formatting for each of these 
was definitely a challenge for me.  Once we were able to get this correct, we were able to apply what we learned with the candidates and run similar
code for the county data.  We were also able to determine that Denver had the highest turnout of voters.

### Election-Audit Summary
This script can be presented to the election commission to be used for future elections even at higher levels, like the state election.  If we were presented with this task, 
we would be able to use the same skeleton, just with a few adjustments geared toward that specific election.  For example, we would change the variable names to match our new criteria.  Instead of using counties_voting and county_winning_percentage we may use state_winning_percentage.  If more or less than 3 candidate are running, we would adjsut index and the for loop.  We would also change the headings for the text file.
